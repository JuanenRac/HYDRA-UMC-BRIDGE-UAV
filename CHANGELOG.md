# Changelog

## [0.0.1]

- Added a dependency-free UAV flight-request coordination core
  (`UavCoordinator`): a real, named vocabulary (`PRE_FLIGHT_CHECK`/
  `TAKEOFF`/`GOTO_WAYPOINT`/`HOVER_AND_CAPTURE`/`RETURN_TO_LAUNCH`)
  gated through the shared `HYDRA-UMC-SDK` safety contract.
- Added the required link-loss watchdog: `HeartbeatMonitor`, a real,
  deterministic (explicit `now`, no real sleeps) failsafe state machine
  with its own real timeout-boundary tests - never-observed, fresh,
  exactly-at-timeout, one instant past timeout, and recovery after a
  later heartbeat.
- Added non-mutating build-test scripts and CI SDK checkout, matching
  the rest of the External Automation / Mobile Bridges family.
- Standardized README (English + Spanish so far, remaining languages
  to follow), project banner and manifest to match the ecosystem's
  established-project structure.
- No real MAVLink/DJI OSDK transport adapter or physical UAV validated
  yet - this is a plan-only coordination boundary.
